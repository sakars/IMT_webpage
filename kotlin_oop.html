            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Kotlin is a statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It is designed to be fully
                    interoperable with Java, allowing developers to use both languages within the same project. Kotlin
                    offers a more concise syntax compared to Java, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability.
                </p>
                <h3>Comparison with Java</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> Kotlin reduces the amount of boilerplate code, making the codebase
                        more concise and readable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Null Safety:</strong> Kotlin has built-in null safety, which helps prevent null pointer
                        exceptions, a common issue in Java.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, meaning you can call
                        Kotlin code from Java and vice versa.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coroutines:</strong> Kotlin provides coroutines for asynchronous programming, making it
                        easier to write non-blocking code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart Casts:</strong> Kotlin's smart cast feature automatically casts types without the
                        need for explicit casting.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, Kotlin aims to improve developer productivity and code safety while maintaining
                    compatibility with existing Java codebases.</p>

                <h3>Classes and Objects</h3>
                <p>In Kotlin, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class can contain properties and methods.
                    Here is an example of a simple class in Kotlin:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-kotlin">
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
    fun greet() {
        println("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>To create an object of the class, you use the <code>new</code> keyword:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-kotlin">
val person = Person("John", 30)
person.greet()
                </code></pre>

                <h3>Inheritance</h3>
                <p>Kotlin supports inheritance, allowing you to create a new class that is based on an existing class.
                    The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class. Here is an example:</p>
                <pre><code class="language-kotlin">
open class Animal(val name: String) {
    open fun sound() {
        println("$name makes a sound")
    }
}

class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun sound() {
        println("$name barks")
    }
}
                </code></pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>Dog</code> class inherits from the <code>Animal</code> class and overrides
                    the <code>sound</code> method.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Kotlin is a powerful and modern programming language that offers many features to improve developer
                    productivity and code safety. Its interoperability with Java makes it an excellent choice for
                    existing Java projects, and its concise syntax and advanced features make it a joy to work with.</p>
