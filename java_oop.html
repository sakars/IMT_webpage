            <h2 itemprop="headline">Introduction</h2>
            <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as
                    few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
                    to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can
                    run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
                <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which
                    can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and
                    code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>
                <p>In this article, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Java and how it implements the
                    principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. It refers to the bundling of data with the
                    methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's
                    components. This is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and
                    data.</p>
                <p>In Java, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers. The most common access modifiers are
                    private, protected, and public. By using these access modifiers, we can control the visibility of
                    class members.</p>
                <p>Encapsulation helps to make the code more modular and easier to maintain. It also enhances the
                    security of the application by hiding the internal state of objects and only exposing a controlled
                    interface.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Inheritance is another core concept of OOP. It allows a new class to inherit the properties and
                    methods of an existing class. The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class, and
                    the class from which it inherits is called the superclass or base class.</p>
                <p>Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. In Java,
                    inheritance is implemented using the 'extends' keyword.</p>
                <p>Through inheritance, we can create a new class that is a refined version of an existing class, adding
                    new features or modifying existing ones without altering the original class.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows one interface to be used
                    for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method
                    overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already
                    defined in its superclass. Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the
                    same name, but different parameters.</p>
                <p>Polymorphism enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code by allowing the same method to
                    behave differently based on the object that it is acting upon.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Abstraction</h2>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the
                    essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.</p>
                <p>In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class
                    that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by its
                    subclasses. An interface is a reference type in Java, it is similar to a class, and is a collection
                    of abstract methods.</p>
                <p>Abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. It provides a clear
                    separation between the interface and the implementation.</p>
