                Struggling with Object-Oriented Programming? So are we! That’s why we organize watch parties at the University of Latvia.  
                Instead of suffering alone, we gather, put the lecture on a projector, and follow along with our laptops.  
                Expect a mix of productivity, humor, and lots of inside jokes about OOP!

            <h2>Who can join?</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone is welcome! However, it’s especially helpful for students currently taking this course.  
                We usually bring our own snacks, so feel free to bring something to share—no pressure, though!  
                The event is completely free.
            </p>
            
            <h2>What’s the plan?</h2>
            <p>
                We’ll watch the lecture together, snack, and have fun. To make things even more entertaining,  
                we’ve created OOP Bingo cards featuring the funniest and most bizarre moments from class.
