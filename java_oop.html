                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have
                        as
                        few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language
                        intended
                        to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code
                        can
                        run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>
                    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects",
                        which
                        can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties),
                        and
                        code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>
                    <p>In this article, we will explore the fundamental concepts of Java and how it implements the
                        principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. It refers to the bundling of data with
                        the
                        methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's
                        components. This is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and
                        data.</p>
                    <p>In Java, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers. The most common access modifiers are
                        private, protected, and public. By using these access modifiers, we can control the visibility
                        of
                        class members.</p>
                    <p>Encapsulation helps to make the code more modular and easier to maintain. It also enhances the
                        security of the application by hiding the internal state of objects and only exposing a
                        controlled
                        interface.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Inheritance</h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Inheritance is another core concept of OOP. It allows a new class to inherit the properties and
                        methods of an existing class. The class that inherits is called the subclass or derived class,
                        and
                        the class from which it inherits is called the superclass or base class.</p>
                    <p>Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes. In
                        Java,
                        inheritance is implemented using the 'extends' keyword.</p>
                    <p>Through inheritance, we can create a new class that is a refined version of an existing class,
                        adding
                        new features or modifying existing ones without altering the original class.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows one interface to be
                        used
                        for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method
                        overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already
                        defined in its superclass. Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with
                        the
                        same name, but different parameters.</p>
                    <p>Polymorphism enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code by allowing the same method
                        to
                        behave differently based on the object that it is acting upon.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Abstraction</h2>
                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the
                        essential features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.</p>
                    <p>In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a
                        class
                        that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods that must be implemented by its
                        subclasses. An interface is a reference type in Java, it is similar to a class, and is a
                        collection
                        of abstract methods.</p>
                    <p>Abstraction allows us to focus on what an object does instead of how it does it. It provides a
                        clear
                        separation between the interface and the implementation.</p>
